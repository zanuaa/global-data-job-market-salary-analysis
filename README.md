## Project Overview
This project analyzes global data job market salaries using SQL to uncover salary patterns based on job roles, experience levels, and employment types.

## Dataset
Global Data Job Market Salary Dataset (public dataset).

## Objectives
Regional Salary Trends
Experience-Based Pay Scales
Employment Type Distribution

## Analysis Approach
- Data exploration and aggregation using SQL queries.
- Use of filtering, grouping, and window functions.

## Conclusion

The analysis shows that data-related roles are increasingly specialized by business domain, and salary levels rise significantly with experience. The largest compensation gap appears between mid-level and senior roles, indicating strong demand for advanced expertise. Geographic factors also play a major role, with Western markets—particularly the United States—offering the highest salary premiums.

## Recommendations

- For Job Seekers: Focus on domain specialization and accelerate progression toward senior roles to maximize salary potential, especially in high-paying global markets.
- For Employers: Offer competitive compensation, clear career paths, and flexible work arrangements to attract and retain skilled data professionals.
- For Workforce Development: Prioritize upskilling pathways from entry to mid and senior levels to meet the growing demand for specialized data talent.
